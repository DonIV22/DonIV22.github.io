**Abstract:** We report on a class of architected material lattices that exploit multi-stability and kinematic amplification to independently adjust the local effective mass, damping, and stiffness properties, thereby realizing congruent alterations to the acoustic dispersion response post-fabrication. The fundamental structural tuning element permits a broad range in the effective property space; moreover, its particular design carries the benefit of tuning without altering the original size/shape of the emerging structure. The relation between the tuning element geometry and the achieved variability in effective properties is explored. Bloch's theorem facilitates the dynamic analysis of representative one- and two-dimensional (1D/2D) systems, revealing, e.g., bandgap formation, migration, and closure and positive/negative metadamping in accordance with the tuning element configuration. To demonstrate a utility, we improvise a waveguide by appropriately patterning the tuning element configuration within a 2D system. We believe that the proposed strategy offers a new way to expand the range of performance and functionality of architected materials for elastodynamics.
