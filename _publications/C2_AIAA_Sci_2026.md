**Abstract:** This work presents a novel passive control strategy for wall-bounded turbulence using a resonant phononic material (RPM) embedded beneath the surface of a turbulent channel flow. The RPM is modeled as a mass–spring–damper chain tuned to interact with near-wall turbulence. Using a weakly coupled fluid–metamaterial interaction (FMI) framework, we demonstrate that the RPM response passively synchronizes across panels and redistributes spectral energy in the wall pressure, from the prescribed structural resonance frequency, $$\omega^*$$, to the corresponding second harmonic component, $$2\omega^*$$. This nonlinear coupling leads to transient drag reduction, followed by a decay in surface motion as the system shifts out of resonance. The study highlights key physical mechanisms in RPM–flow coupling and informs future design of passive, energy-efficient flow control surfaces for aerodynamic applications.
