**Abstract:** Historically, structural defects in crystalline material lattice structures have been viewed as a liability, causing the material behavior to deviate from the expected norm. However, the gradual improvement in understanding the role of defects has overturned this view, encouraging positive outlooks, e.g., deliberately engineering defects in structures, that have laid the foundation for modern applications, e.g., silicon chip manufacturing, battery engineering, fuel cell engineering. In recent years, acoustic metamaterials (AMMs), which have emerged as a platform for customizing acoustic behavior, have also embraced this shift in viewpoint, enabling design propositions involving precisely embedded defects in the AMM architecture that may be relevant for applications, e.g., energy harvesting, waveguiding, flow control. The fundamental utility of defects stems from their ability to robustly localize energy at a prescribed location with desirable spatio-temporal characteristics. However, the bulk of existing defect-based AMM studies primarily present a qualitative numerical analysis, prompting the need for an analytical approach quantifying the defect eigenmode characteristics, e.g., frequency, mode shape, resonance velocity amplitude envelope to precisely engineer defects in AMMs. This article presents a modified analytical method to determine the eigenmode characteristics of a defect-embedded grounded monoatomic chain (DMoA) and demonstrates the benefits of defect modes through two DMoA-based AMMs that can accommodate -- (i) a virtual ground, and (ii) achieve customized acoustic interaction and absorption. The proposed strategy can be readily extended to more elaborate AMMs and augments the design space for defect-based AMMs.
