I'm Postdoctoral researcher at UIUC, working with [Prof. Kathryn Matlack](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JX7S9ZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in the [Wave Propagation and Metamaterials Laboratory](https://matlack.mechanical.illinois.edu/). My current research investigates interaction of various fluid flows with phononic materials (e.g., phononic crystals, metamaterials) where, the devised material architecture customizes the fluid-structure coupling and enables control of the flow characteristics, e.g., laminar-to-turbulent transition, turbulent drag reduction, flow separation. 

I completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California San Diego where, I worked with [Prof. Michael Frazier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zu1DR1sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My thesis research focused on [<i>Phase transition and domain wall control in multistable metamaterials</i>](https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a976661c0bb149005068169a0ea8a5/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y). In providing several strategies to realize and control the phase morphologies within multistable metamaterials, my dissertation promotes their adoption for applications in energy harvesting, mechanical memory devices and deployable structures.
